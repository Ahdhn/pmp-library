[TOC]

This section provides a hands-on tutorial showing the basic usage of PMP. For a
thorough introduction to polygon mesh processing we refer to the book of Botsch
et al. \cite botsch_2010_polygon.

## Introduction

In general, a polygonal surface mesh is composed of vertices, edges and faces as
well as the incidence relationships between them. pmp::SurfaceMesh stores the
connectivity information based on halfedges, i.e., pairs of directed edges with
opposing direction. To be more precise:

- Each vertex stores an outgoing halfedge.
- Each face stores an incident halfedge.
- Each halfedge stores its incident face, its target vertex, and its previous
  and next halfedges within the face.

The halfedge connectivity is illustrated in the figure below:

In the following sections we describe the basic usage of pmp::SurfaceMesh by
means of simple example programs and code excerpts.

## Basics

The very basic usage of pmp::SurfaceMesh is demonstrated in the example below. The
program first instantiates a pmp::SurfaceMesh object as well as four vertex
handles. These handles, as well as the handles for the other mesh entities
`Halfedge`, `Edge` and `Face` basically indices. Four vertices are added to the
mesh, as well as four triangular faces composing a tetrahedron. Finally, the
number of vertices, edges, and faces is printed to standard output.

## Iterators and Circulators

In order to sequentially access mesh entities pmp::SurfaceMesh provides
iterators for each entity type:

1. pmp::SurfaceMesh::VertexIterator
2. pmp::SurfaceMesh::HalfedgeIterator
3. pmp::SurfaceMesh::EdgeIterator
4. pmp::SurfaceMesh::FaceIterator

Similar to iterators, pmp::SurfaceMesh also provides circulators for the ordered
enumeration of all incident vertices, halfedges, or faces around a given face or
vertex. The example below demonstrates the use of iterators and circulators for
computing the mean valence of a mesh.

## Dynamic Properties

Attaching additional attributes to mesh entities is important for many
applications. pmp::SurfaceMesh supports properties by means of synchronized arrays
that can be (de-)allocated dynamically at run-time. Property arrays are also
used internally, e.g., to store vertex coordinates. The example program below
shows how to access vertex coordinates through the pre-defined point property.

\snippet barycenter.cpp barycenter

The dynamic (de-)allocation of properties at run-time is managed by a set
of four different functions.

- Add a new property of a specific type for a given entity. Example:

  ```cpp
  auto vertex_weights = mesh.add_vertex_property<Scalar>("v:weight");
  ```

- Get a handle to an existing property. Example:

  ```cpp
  auto points = mesh.get_vertex_property<Point>("v:point");
  ```

- Get or add: Return a handle to an existing property if a property of the
  same type and name exists. If there is no such property, a new one is
  allocated and its handle is returned. Example:

  ```cpp
  auto edge_weights = mesh.edge_property<Scalar>("e:weight");
  ```

- Remove a property given its handle:

  ```cpp
  auto face_colors = mesh.face_property<Color>("f:color");
  mesh.remove_face_property(face_colors);
  ```

Functions that allocate a new property take an optional default value for the
property as a second argument. Example:

```cpp
mesh.face_property<Color>("f:color", Color(1.0, 0.0, 0.0));
```

The code excerpt below demonstrates how to
allocate, use and remove a custom edge property.

## Connectivity Queries

Commonly used connectivity queries such as retrieving the next
halfedge or the target vertex of an halfedge are illustrated below.

```cpp
Halfedge h;
auto h0 = mesh.next_halfedge(h);
auto h1 = mesh.prev_halfedge(h);
auto h2 = mesh.opposite_halfedge(h);
auto f  = mesh.face(h);
auto v0 = mesh.from_vertex(h);
auto v1 = mesh.to_vertex(h);
```

## Topological Operations

pmp::SurfaceMesh also offers higher-level topological operations, such as
performing edge flips, edge splits, face splits, or halfedge collapses. The
figure below illustrates some of these operations.

![High-level operations changing the topology.](./images/topology-changes.png)

The corresponding member functions and their syntax is demonstrated in the
pseudo-code below.

```cpp
Vertex   v;
Edge     e;
Halfedge h;
Face     f;

mesh.split(f, v);
mesh.split(e, v);
mesh.flip(e);
mesh.collapse(h);
```

When entities are removed from the mesh due to topological changes, the member
function pmp::SurfaceMesh::garbage_collection() has to be called in order to
ensure the consistency of the data structure.

## File I/O

All I/O operations are handled by the pmp::read() and pmp::write() functions.
They take a mesh, a file path, and optional pmp::IOFlags as an argument.

We currently support reading and writing several standard file formats: OFF,
OBJ, STL. See the reference documentation for the pmp::read() and pmp::write()
functions for details on which format supports reading / writing which type of
data.

A simple example reading and writing a mesh is shown below.

## Eigen Interoperability

The pmp-library supports some level of interoperability with Eigen. The
pmp::Matrix and pmp::Vector classes can be constructed/assigned from Eigen
matrix/vector types. In addition, it possible to cast the pmp::Matrix and
pmp::Vector classes to Eigen.

Example for construction:

```cpp
// construction from Eigen
Eigen::Vector3d eigen_vector(1.0, 2.0, 3.0);
pmp::dvec3 pmp_vector = eigen_vector;
```

Example for assignment:

```cpp
// assignment from Eigen
Eigen::Vector3d eigen_vector(1.0, 2.0, 3.0);
pmp::dvec3 pmp_vector;
pmp_vector = eigen_vector;
```

Example for cast:

```cpp
// cast to Eigen
pmp::vec3 pmp_vector(1.0, 2.0, 3.0);
Eigen::Vector3f eigen_vector = static_cast<Eigen::Vector3f>(pmp_vector);
```

See the reference documentation for pmp::Matrix and pmp::Vector for more details.
